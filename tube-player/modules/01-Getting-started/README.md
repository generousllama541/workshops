# Module 1 - Getting Started

Uno Platform provides a multi-platform solution for building native apps for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Web, as well as Linux.

This module will walk you through the process of getting started with Uno Platform and creating a project using either the template wizard or the dotnet new template, that includes features to serve the requirements of this workshop.

If you are new to the Uno Platform, you may also want to check out [Uno Docs - Get Started](xref:Uno.GetStarted).

## Setting up the Environment

Prepare for our app workshop by setting up your environment for Uno app development. Just follow the documentation for your IDE.

 - [Visual Studio](xref:Uno.GetStarted.vs2022)
 - [VS Code](xref:Uno.GetStarted.vscode)
 - [Rider](xref:Uno.GetStarted.Rider)

## Obtaining a YouTube Data API v3 Key [optional]

This app will eventually search and play YouTube videos. To query this data from YouTube, a YouTube API v3 needs to be obtained. You can skip this part if you prefer running the app with local sample search data instead.

In the following steps, we will walk you through [this tutorial](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started), and provide you with detailed screenshots on how to obtain a YouTube Data API v3 key.

## Creating the project

To create a new Uno Platform app, there are two options available to developers. The first is to use the Visual Studio extension which provides a guided approach to creating an Uno Platform app.
The other one is to use the dotnet new `unoapp` template, which enables customizing the generated projects with parameters and modifiers.

In the following sections, we will cover both methods for creating a new Uno app, providing step-by-step instructions for each.

You might be asked to reload the IDE before the projects are fully loaded. Click reload if you see this message.

## Rename files

1. Rename the file *Presentation* â†’ *SecondModel.cs* to *VideoDetailsModel.cs*, and *SecondPage.cs* to *VideoDetailsPage.cs*.  
    If you're using Visual Studio and you're asked to also rename all references of `SecondPage` and `SecondModel` click *Yes*.

    ![Visual Studio rename file dialog](rename-file-dialog.jpg)

1. In *VideoDetailsModel.cs*, ensure the record name has changed to `VideoDetailsModel`, otherwise change it manually.

1. In *VideoDetailsPage.cs*, ensure `SecondPage` has changed to `VideoDetailsPage` in both the class name and constructor, otherwise change it manually, then change `BindableSecondModel` to `BindableVideoDetailsModel`.

1. Make sure these references have also been changed in *App.xaml.cs*.

1. In *App.xaml.cs*, also rename the route map path from `Second` to `VideoDetails`:

    ```c#
    new RouteMap("VideoDetails", View: views.FindByViewModel<VideoDetailsModel>()),
    ```

As explained [in the intro](xref:Workshop.TubePlayer.Overview#tube-player-workshop), the app will consist of two pages, a search page, and a video-player page. *MainPage.cs* and *MainModel.cs* will be used as the search page, whereas *VideoDetailsPage.cs* and *VideoDetailsModel.cs* to display additional video details and the media player.

## Running the application

1. Select the target framework (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows) and the device or emulator you want to deploy to. The emulator can be selected from the subsequent menu as shown in the picture:

    ![Visual Studio - Startup projects dropdown](set-startup-project.png)

1. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to run the project.  
  This is what you expect the app to look like:

    ![Running app in operation](ui-output.gif)

> [!NOTE]  
> If you see an error message mentioning the old type names (*SecondPage*/*SecondModel*), try cleaning the solution. In Visual Studio, you'd right-click the solution and then *Clean*. Otherwise, call `dotnet clean` from the `TubePlayer`'s solution folder.
